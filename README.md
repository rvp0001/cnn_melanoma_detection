## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
- Data augmentation for accuracy improvement
- Dropouts for accuracy improvement
- SMOTE to reduce class imbalance

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model will overfit if training data is less
- Batch size important to optimise memory usage
- Real size images need to refit
- Augmentation using image transformation will reduce overfitting
- Drop outs will improve accuracy
- Reducing class imbalance will help improve accuracy
- Transfer learning to further improve accuracy
